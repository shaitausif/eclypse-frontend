Project Title: Eclypse-Project
A Full-Stack E-commerce/Web Application Built with React and Node.js
This repository contains the source code for a modern, responsive web application developed as part of an internship assignment. The project aims to deliver a fully functional website, adhering closely to a provided Figma prototype, demonstrating proficiency in contemporary web development practices and a strong focus on user interface implementation.

üöÄ Overview
This application focuses on delivering a visually accurate and highly interactive user interface, as specified by a Figma prototype. It features a robust frontend built with React, ensuring a dynamic and intuitive user experience, seamlessly integrated with a powerful Node.js Express backend for data handling. The entire application is developed using TypeScript, promoting type safety and maintainability.

‚ú® Key Features
Figma Prototype Adherence: Meticulous implementation of the user interface based on a provided Figma prototype, ensuring visual fidelity and a polished user experience.

Shopping Cart Management: Functionality to add, update, and remove items from the shopping cart, providing a dynamic shopping experience.

Checkout Process: A streamlined checkout flow that includes address submission and a clear order summary.

Form Validation: Robust client-side form validation for a smooth and error-free user input experience.

Responsive Design: Optimized user interface for various devices and screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and usability across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
This project leverages a comprehensive set of modern technologies and libraries across both the frontend and backend to ensure a high-quality, scalable, and maintainable application.

Frontend
React: A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enhancing code quality and developer experience.

Zod: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, used for robust form validation.

React Hook Form: A performant and flexible library for form management with easy-to-use validation.

React Toastify: A popular library for adding beautiful and customizable toast notifications.

Context API: Utilized for efficient global state management, providing a centralized data store for application-wide data.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs directly in your markup (inferred from the code snippet).

Lucide React: Icon library for crisp and scalable vector icons (inferred from the code snippet).

React Router DOM: For declarative routing within the React application (inferred from the code snippet).

Backend
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable server-side applications.

Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building RESTful APIs.

Mongoose: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment, providing schema-based solutions for application data.

TypeScript: Applied to the backend for type safety and improved code organization.

Database
MongoDB: A NoSQL, document-oriented database used for flexible and scalable data storage.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

MongoDB (local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

Git

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory (or wherever your Node.js project is located).

cd backend # Adjust path if your backend is in a different folder
npm install # or yarn install

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your environment variables.

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
# Add any other environment variables your backend uses (e.g., JWT_SECRET)

Replace your_mongodb_connection_string with your MongoDB connection URI (e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname or your MongoDB Atlas connection string).

Start the backend server:

npm start # or yarn start

The backend server should now be running, typically on http://localhost:5000 (or the PORT you specified).

3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory (or wherever your React project is located).

cd ../frontend # Adjust path if your frontend is in a different folder
npm install # or yarn install

Create a .env file in the frontend directory and add your environment variables.

REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000 # Or your deployed backend URL
# Add any other environment variables your frontend uses

Start the React development server:

npm start # or yarn start

The frontend application should now be running, typically on http://localhost:3000.

üöÄ Usage
Once both the frontend and backend servers are running:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

[Describe how to use your application, e.g., "Navigate through the application's various pages, interact with forms, and observe the responsive design.", "Add items to the shopping cart and proceed through the checkout process."]

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
This application is designed for flexible deployment. The frontend (React) can be deployed as a static site, and the backend (Node.js Express) as a server, or serverless functions.

For the internship, a common and recommended approach for separate deployments is using platforms like Vercel for the React frontend and Vercel/Render/Heroku for the Node.js backend, configuring CORS appropriately to allow cross-origin communication.
